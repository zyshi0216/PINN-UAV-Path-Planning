### 📘 Abstract  
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in **dynamic wind fields** face major challenges in generating trajectories that are both **energy-efficient** and **physically feasible**.  
This repository presents a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** framework that integrates UAV dynamics, drag effects, wind disturbances, and obstacle potentials directly into the learning process.  
Compared with classical **A\*** and **Kino-RRT\*** planners, our method yields **smoother**, **safer**, and **more interpretable** trajectories.  

> 🧩 *No external training data is required – the physical equations themselves act as supervision.*
